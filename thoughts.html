 	<h3>a perspective on diversity in tech </h3>
 	<br>in the united states today, the systems of both oppression and inequality that influences our societal structures has privileged the demographic who has the most access to learning technology and thus, heavily influences the creation of minority groups within the technology industry. for one of the fastest growing, in-demand, and highest paid professions, i find it concerning that our structures in society make it more difficult to not only recruit, but retain minority groups within the technology field.
 	</br>
 	<br>
	according to a recent study by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the amount of computer science or other technology graduate projections cannot keep up with the job demand projections for 2024. now more than ever, as the number technology jobs available increases without graduates to fill them, the inclusion of minority groups is one of the most important investments an institution can make to advance technology in our society.
	</br>
	<br>
	my passion to bring minorities into computing is motivated by the idea that the more diverse minds that are working on technology, the more effectively our world will progress.
