      Hi! Here's a snipit of my life story:
    </br>
    <br>
      I was born in New York City, but I lived about 7 years of my early life in India with my grandmother while my mother was studying
      her graduate degree at Columbia University.
      In India I attended an International Boarding School where at a young age I was exposed to various cultures around the world,
      ways of thinking, and communicating. I will be honest - I didn't enjoy being half the world away from my family,
      but looking back at it I had to grow
      up quickly at an early age to understand people from many different cultures. My closest friends were from Tibet,
      Maldives, China, Switzerland, and Germany. To this day I can attribute some of my
      qualities of easily getting along with anyone to my experiences at International Boarding School.
    </br>
    <br>
      In the United States, I've lived in New York City, Washington D.C., and Indiana. My favorite of these places
      is New York City. I love the diversity and entrepreneurial mindset that energizes
      the city. I attend Indiana University Bloomington, studying Computer Science and Technology Entreprenuership with
      specializations in Artificial Intelligence and Systems Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Informatics.
    </br>
    <br>
      I'm obsessed with innovation - I believe that change is exicting, and I want to work with a company that
      invites fast iterations, new ideas, and people like me eager to make the world more
      effecient by exploiting the power of code.
    </br>
    <br>
      In my free time I run, paint with watercolors, eat pizza, <a href="library.html">read</a>, and practice yoga. I enjoy meeting new
      people, so if we haven't met please feel welcome to reach out via email.
