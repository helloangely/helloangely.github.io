      I was born in New York City, but I lived about 7 years of my early life in India with my grandmother while my mother was studying
      her graduate degree. For two years I attended an International Boarding School in India, where at
      a young age I was exposed to various cultures around the world, ways of thinking and communicating. At the time, I didn't really like
      being away from my family and only visitng over the holidays - but looking back at it, I had to grow
      up very quickly at such an early age and understand people from many different cultures. My closest friends were from Tibet,
      Maldives, China, Switzerland, and Germany. To this day, I can attribute some of my
      qualities of easily getting along with anyone to my experiences at International Boarding School.

      In the United States, I've lived in New York City, Washington D.C., and Indiana. My favorite of these places
      is New York City. I love the diversity and entrepreneurial mindset that energizes
      the city. I attend Indiana University Bloomington, studying Computer Science and Technology Entreprenuership with
      specializations in Artificial Intelligence and Systems Engineering and minors in Mathematics and Informatics.

      I'm obsessed with innovation - I believe that change is exicting, and I want to work with a company that
      invites fast iterations, new ideas, and people like me eager to make the world more
      effecient by exploiting the power of code.
